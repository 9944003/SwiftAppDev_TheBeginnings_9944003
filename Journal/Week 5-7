# Week 5 -7
Caught up on book, investigated programing in playgrounds on the IPad as had been unwell.
I found it hard to get my head around creating on the playgrounds.  I looked into Books creation on Playgrounds and my research into this was awesome.,  There are great uses I cna think of for the Books.  I did not think it was apt for the Background changing app for assessment 1.
