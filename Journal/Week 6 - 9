### Wednesday 11th September
Working as a team to develop an app That scans a student ID and brings up a corresponding timetable.  
Working with the 4 other Swift developers means early morning Wednesdays (which were hard to remember) and working with an all ready established group.  

### Wednesday 18th September
I found I was very stand off-ish and found i was a little afraid to code on my own not to step out of the group and there way fo doing things. Feeling like other people were more qualified.  Will be good thing to be aware of next time so I can ensure I cantribute and ask questions.  Not being afraid to code. 

### Wednesday 25th September
The stress of getting the assessment in as we have 5 of us working on assessment and 2 available computers.  We had trouble getting API working.
Working with the 2 computers had some time and physical capabilities to work around.  We had managed to get app in on time and decide on our bugs and features to add for next assessment.
