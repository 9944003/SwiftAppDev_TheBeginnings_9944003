# Week 2 July 19 2017

It has taken 2 hours to get the Markdown and basic Apple OS, Xcode, Terminal, Github, navigation and usability up to standard.  

Sorted how to use speach to read iBook to me.  

Reading about Variables and Constants.  My previous programming I have worked with these terminologys in C# Programming it is helpful to have this understanding.

# Friday 20th Week 2 Constants, Variables

It was difficult to remember I was using Xcode not the visual studio markdown and git.  Will need to be refreashed.  Read through to 1.3.

I could not get the code right as time constraints after reading chapter and fustratingly fumbling through the new OS navigation and Xcode.  I thought previewer wouild open xcode, but that is playgound.  Very unsatisfying feel like this has been as waste of 50 minutes as I run out of time and have not completed the tasks.  

# Unit test 7/7 for the constants, variables, type constructsx, type inference
