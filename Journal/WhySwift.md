# Why I choose Swift App Development

I have not worked with Apple OS since Mactintosh 64.  I also want to be able to apply the knowledge I have gained from previous programming and web development papers.  Applying the process to learning any new technology.  

I believe these essential skills as application and internet programming / development is always changing, at a rapid pace.  To keep uop is to be able to learn these new technologies continiusly.  

To apply the best practices, design principals, producing clean code, user experience first, applications.  

The other topics did interest me, but my style of learning I liked the structure the 'Swift App Development' iBook offered.
